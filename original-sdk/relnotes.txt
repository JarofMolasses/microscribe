A small error was found in the file hci.c.  The error would only affect
the operation in background and motion modes.  To fix the error, line
799 in the file hci.c (in the function hci_build_packet) must be
changed from

else if (hci->packet.num_bytes_needed > 0)

to

if (!hci->packet.parsed && hci->packet.num_bytes_needed > 0)

The earlier version of this code would not cause the program to crash.
The only issue was that 2 calls to arm_check_bckg or arm_check_motion
were required in order to build a packet and get an update even if
a complete data packet had already been received.




Enclosed is the Software Development Kit version 1-2 for the
Immersion MicroScribe-3D Digitizer.  While this newest release
of the SDK is fully backward-compatible with previous versions,
some changes were made that make small improvements in the
accuracy of the MicroScribe-3D.  These improvements in accuracy
will only be seen if your application compiles and links with
this new SDK.  We therefore ask that you replace older versions
of the SDK with this version right away.

In addition to improved accuracy, SDK 1-2 now unifies PC, Mac,
and Unix/SGI versions into one SDK.  You need only use the
appropriate driveXXX.c file (drivepc.c, drivemac.c, driveunx.c)
for your platform.  Refer to the readme.XXX (readme.dos,
readme.mac, readme.unx) for more information.

Your application program should #include the files hci.h and
arm.h (previous versions of the SDK only required arm.h).
